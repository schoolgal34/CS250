Throughout this course, I learned about and took on different parts of a scrum team. 
The team consisted of the product owner, scrum master, developers and testers. 
The roles I learned about and took on allowed me to gain a better understanding as a team member. 
The scrum master is the main role that I will speak more about as this paper progresses.
