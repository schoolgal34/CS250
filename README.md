How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  By conducting interviews and using user observations to identify their needs. Creating user stories will help by providing ideas of how the value of the project will be perceived by the consumer. 

  
How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  The way to approach developing a program would be to keep practicing by ways of putting the frameworks together to produce a program with integration and development. When it comes to Agile processes, sprint planning should always be at the forefront and with the sprint planning, you can hold the daily meetings where you will plan and receive the necessary feedback for any future developments. 


What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  Communicating with all team members through meetings and offering feedback while accepting it as well. Helping the other team members and accepting the help they can offer me as well.
